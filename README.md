## statsexamen

This is the Github repository for the stats exam at Universit√© de Bordeaux in November 2015. The original data file can be found here as "lesionsBIM.txt". The analysis was carried out in R studio, using the R markdown format. Some supplementary analysis was supplied using excel, and can be found in the files in "normality check results.xlsx" and "signifiance.xlsx".

Contributions to the analysis were made by Marishka Mehta and Maxime Houtekamer.
